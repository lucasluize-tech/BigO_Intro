# Bloom Filter

is a Data structure that uses multiple hash functions to store bits in memory.
if we have at least one vacant slot in memory after hashing the data , the data was not
stored.
WE CAN GET FALSE POSITIVES ( RETURN YES TO A NO AWNSER, very rare)
BUT WE CAN BE CERTAIN THAT A VALUE IS NOT THERE! ( RETURN YES ALWAYS FOR YES AWNSER)
