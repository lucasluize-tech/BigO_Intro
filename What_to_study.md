# Path Fiding

Algorithms for finding the most efficient path in weighted graphs.

- **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- **A/\***

## What should I know ?

- Knowing when to use arrays, objects, lls, trees and graphs
- Big O notation, runtime
- identifying recursion
- traversal in LLs, trees and graphs via BFS AND DFS
- searching and traversing of binary search trees
- how hashing/hash tables work

## What I must be asked About?

- Selecting a data structure (strenghs and weakness)
- Big O notation
